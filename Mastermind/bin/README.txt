This is the skeleton code for the Mastermind Game.

Your job is to fill in all the places where it says 
"your code goes here".

Please feel free to change the implied flow of the game and the GUI if
you like. Currently it's set up to draw a grid in a Frame and to read
one button press (for "submit guess") and a couple of different
MouseEvents (one to select a color and one to select where to put the
color. It's also set up to use a variable called "currentRow" to keep
track of which row of squares to display the current guess from the
player and response from the program. Notice that current Row is passed
to the view.fillBoard() method so it knows where fill in the rectangles with
color. You may also change any of the variable names. And "fillRect" is
a hint.

If you don't want to change the GUI, just fill in all the code places.

Good luck!
